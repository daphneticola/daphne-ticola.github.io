Hello! I'm **Daphne Ticola, M.Ed.**, an instructional systems designer with a background in education and a focus on designing meaningful, learner-centered instructional experiences.

I am a Department of Defense contractor supporting training and instructional development efforts that contribute to warfighter readiness, performance, and mission effectiveness through systematic instructional design practices.

I hold a **Master of Education (M.Ed.) in Secondary Education** and am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Instructional Technology and Design (MSITD)** at the **University of North Alabama (UNA)**. Through my graduate studies, I am deepening my expertise in instructional design theory, instructional media, and technology-enhanced learning environments.

This portfolio serves as both an academic and professional space to showcase selected coursework, design artifacts, and reflections that demonstrate my ability to analyze learning needs, apply research-based theory, and design instruction aligned to real-world learning contexts.
